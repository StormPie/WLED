## Welcome to a UI update for WLED 

WLED is a fast and (relatively) secure implementation of an ESP8266/ESP32 webserver to control NeoPixel (WS2812B) LEDs!

This library is primarily a new UI based on the WLED API. It is mobile friendly and will be improved over time.

This version of WLED also has some extra lines of code to block any data going to the LEDs until the ESP is ready, this uses extra hardware.
